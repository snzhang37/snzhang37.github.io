I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. My research interests focus on network optimization and artificial intelligence.

Under the guidance of Prof. Zuqing Zhu, I have worked on designing efficient algorithms for hitless reconfiguration in optical networks, which has been accepted by IEEE JSAC. Currently, I lead a project on optical network protection and restoration technologies, while contributing to theoretical research on network reconfiguration. I aim to pursue further studies and contribute to real-world optimization challenges through innovative research.
